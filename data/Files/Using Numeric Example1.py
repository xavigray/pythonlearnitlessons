# Program: Simple Interest Calculator

# Input principal, rate, and time from the user
principal = float (input("Enter the principal amount: "))
rate = float(input("Enter the annual interest rate (%): "))
time = float(input("Enter the time period (in years): "))

# Calculate the simple interest
simple_interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100

# Calculate the total amount
total_amount = principal + simple_interest

# Print the results
